\section{Exercise Execution}
\subsection{Setting up the virtual machines.}
To get started with this CTF, make sure that VirtualBox version 7.1.4 is used. The VM to attack must be imported by double-clicking the provided \texttt{.ova} file. After the import is complete, the network settings must be changed to use Host-only Adapter mode. Since using the default Host-only network did not work, we had to create a new Host-only network. To do this, either press \texttt{<C-h>} or click on \texttt{File} > \texttt{Tools} > \texttt{Network Manager}, as shown in Figure 3.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.285]{./images/openingNetworkManager.png}
	\centering
	\caption{Opening VirtualBox Network Manager settings}
\end{figure}\abc
In this menu, click on \texttt{Create}, then check the \texttt{Enable Server} box to enable the DHCP server so the target VM will receive an IP address. Then, click on \texttt{Adapter} to view the IP range of the network, which in our case is \texttt{192.168.15.0/24}, which can be seen in Figure 4.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{./images/nwipsfr.png}
	\centering
	\caption{Showing the IP settings for the new Host-only network}
	\label{fig:nwconf}
\end{figure}\abc
Next, open the virtual machine settings by selecting the VM in the list and pressing \texttt{<C-s>}. Under the \texttt{Network} section, change the network adapter to use the Host-only Adapter and select the VirtualBox Host-only Ethernet Adapter \#2, which was just created. Perform this step for both the target VM and the Kali VM, as detailed in Figure 5.

\end{figure}\abc
\newpage
\subsection{Reconnaissance: Scanning the Network}
We use the Cyber Kill Chain to structure our steps for completing the CTF, with any attack beginning with reconnaissance, which in this case means scanning the network with \texttt{nmap}. Since we don't know the IP address of the target server yet, we need to scan the network to find it. For this, the command \texttt{nmap 192.168.15.0/24} is used to scan the entire network for open ports, as illustrated in Figure 6.\cite{cyberkillchain}
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/firstnmapscan.png}
	\centering
	\caption{Results of the nmap scan}
\end{figure}\abc
We can determine that the target has the IP address \texttt{192.168.15.3}, since, as seen in \textcolor{blue}{\hyperref[fig:nwconf]{Figure \ref{fig:nwconf}}}, \texttt{.1} is the network address, \texttt{.2} is the \texttt{DHCP} server, and \texttt{.4} is the IP address of the Kali VM. This can be verified by running \texttt{ip a} or by scanning the open ports, since \texttt{ssh} is not exposed.
Now we can run another \texttt{nmap} scan to get fruther information abt the running servives and their version by using the \texttt{sV} flag and use the \texttt{T4} flag which sets the timing to agressive with the value 4 and the \texttt{p} falg with \texttt{-} value to scan all ports. The results of the scan can be seen in Figure 7.\cite{nmap-sv,nmap-t-flag}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/nmapfr.png}
	\centering
	\caption{Results of the detailed nmap scan}
\end{figure}\abc
From this scan, we can see that \texttt{ssh} and four \texttt{http} servers running \texttt{Python 3.12.3} are active on the system.
\subsection{Reconnaissance: Exploring the websites}
If we open the websites in our web browser of choice, we can see that the one on port \texttt{1080} says that to get further, we need to scan deeper, which we already did. The website on port \texttt{5155} shows text from foreign languages, which is randomized and always prints out different text on refresh. The site on port \texttt{10458} prints out a message in \texttt{base64}, and lastly, the one on port \texttt{10448} has a basic authentication login prompt for a mini web shell. Figures 8 shows the content of each webpage.
\newpage
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/allesiten.png}
	\centering
	\caption[a]{Showing the contents of each page using \texttt{curl} \footnotemark}
\end{figure}\abc
\footnotetext{The ports are different from those mentioned before, since instead of using screenshots from the browser, we opted to use \texttt{curl}. Additionally, on every refresh, the ports are randomized.}
The \texttt{base64} message can be decoded by piping the string, using \texttt{echo}, into the \texttt{base64} command, which gives us the hint to use port \texttt{55487}, the site with authentication. This is shown in Figure 9 below.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/base64.png}
	\centering
	\caption{Decoding the \texttt{base64} message}
\end{figure}\abc
To get all the random variants from the site with the foreign languages, I wrote a quick batch script to recursively relay the website and save the output in a file called \texttt{output}, as shown in Figure 10.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
#!/bin/bash
while true;do
    body=$(curl -s 192.168.15:5155)
    echo "$body" >> output
    echo "$body"
done
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/gettextsh.png}
	\centering
	\caption{Running the script}
\end{figure}\abc
After running it for a while, we prompted ChatGPT with the list of outputs to translate, which revealed the following hint, as shown in Figure 11.
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/labngs.png}
	\centering
	\caption{ChatGPT translating the hint}
\end{figure}\abc
\subsection{Weaponization: Evaluating the needed tools}
Now that we know the username and that it uses HTTP Basic Authentication, we can use Hydra to brute-force the password. For this, I have chosen the 10-million-password list as our wordlist \cite{pw-list}
\subsection{Exploitation: Using Hydra to break HTTP basic authentication}
To brute force the password, the following \texttt{hydra} command will be used: \texttt{hydra -l user -P pw.txt -s 55487 -f 192.168.15.3 http-get /}
Here is a breakdown of the options used in the command:\cite{hydra-http-basic-auth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
-l user #specifying the username to attempt logging in with
-P pw.txt #tells Hydra to use the contents of pw.txt as passwords to try
-s 55487 #specifying the port to connect to
-f #telling Hydra to stop after a valid login
192.168.15.3 #setting the target IP address
http-get / #specifying the service and method to use
\end{lstlisting}
After running this command, we find out that the username is \texttt{user} and the password is \texttt{pass}, as seen in Figure 12.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/hydra.png}
	\centering
	\caption{Running the Hydra command to get the credentials}
\end{figure}\abc
\newpage
After entering the found credentials on the webpage, we get the first flag.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/flag1.png}
	\centering
	\caption{First flag found}
\end{figure}\abc
Besides the flag, there is a webshell on the site, so we can run commands on the server. However, interacting through the website is a horrible experience, and that's why we used the command \texttt{whoami} to find out which user we are logged in as so we can SSH into the server instead.
\subsection{Exploitation: Using Hydra to brute force SSH login}
To brute force the SSH login, this Hydra command is used: \abc\texttt{hydra -l GrumpyCat -P pw.txt 192.168.15.3 ssh -t 4}. The only changes made to the command are the username we got through the webshell, replacing the method with SSH, and using the \texttt{-t} flag with a value of 4 to set the max tasks to 4, since some SSH configurations tend to block higher counts. Figure 14 shows the command output. \cite{hydra-ssh}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/hydrassh.png}
	\centering
	\caption{Getting the credentials for the user GrumpyCat}
\end{figure}\abc
\newpage
\subsection{Exploring the system}
\subsubsection{Listing all the files}
Now that we have a shell in the server, it's time to dig around and explore. We started by running \abc \texttt{ls -R / * 2>/dev/null | grep flag}, in which the \texttt{-R} flag is used to recursively list all the files in the root of the file system and the \texttt{*} is used to list everything inside that as well. Lastly, the \texttt{2>/dev/null} redirects \texttt{stderr} to the file \texttt{/dev/null} to effectively delete them from the output, which is piped into \texttt{grep} to filter it to search for files that have \texttt{flag} in their name. To tidy up the output, it can be piped into \texttt{grep} again with the \texttt{-v} flag to exclude results that contain \texttt{flags}. Figure 15 shows the results. \cite{stderr}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/searchingfor falgfiles.png}
	\centering
	\caption{Output of the search command}
\end{figure}\abc
As we can see, we found a file called \texttt{secret\_flag.txt} and \texttt{flag\_process.sh}, for which we can search with the following command: \texttt{find -name "filename" / 2>/dev/null}. Figure 16 displays the found file locations.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{images/findfiles.png}
	\centering
	\caption{File locations of the 2 found files}
\end{figure}\abc
To have a better structure in this documentation, I will list the initial findings from the exploration and create a section for each flag. This will make the document easier to read and more organized.
\subsubsection{Investigating the listening service}
With \texttt{ss -tulnp}, we can examine all listening process services on the system for TCP and UDP, along with the processes they use, if we have permission to see that.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/sstunlp.png}
	\centering
	\caption{Viewing the listening services}
	\label{fig:sstunlp}
\end{figure}\abc
\subsection{Investigating the process flag}
\subsection{Investigating the webserver}
Luckily, as seen in \textcolor{blue}{\hyperref[fig:sstunlp]{Figure \ref{fig:sstunlp}}}, it appears that the webserver has been started as the current user, which we can further inspect with \texttt{ps aux | grep python}. As shown in Figure 18, the process has been started by the root user as GrumpyCat.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/psauxpy.png}
	\centering
	\caption{Inspecting the running Python processes}
\end{figure}\abc
If we read the file \texttt{/bin/ctf\_server.py}, we first see that the ranges of the randomized port ranges are \texttt{4000-5600}, \texttt{10000-12000}, and \texttt{50000-60000}. The intended translation is "Hinweis1: Der Nutzername lautet user", and lastly, a flag hides itself at the bottom of the file, which is shown in Figure 19.

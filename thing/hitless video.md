### Intro:

I am bad at Elden Ring.

(insert stupid deaths here)

So naturally I did what any normal person would do, which is doing a hitless run. Surely doing this was a good idea and didn't end in a complete disaster.Â 

(play epic intro)

### hitless rule thingy part

A hitless run is beating the game without getting hit but here are the the rules which you can find them on the teamhitless website:

- A hit is defined by a loss of health and/or stagger caused by an enemy.
- Hits from player triggered traps count.
- Environmental damage caused by static features as lava, water, swamp, spikes, campfires do not count as a hit.
- Fall damage does not count as a hit, but a death from falling does.
- Blocking an enemy counts as a hit, but a perfect parry does not.
- Quit-outs are generally not allowed, except when in the main hub or after sitting down at a grace.
- Summon Ashes and NPC summons are allowed. Player summons are not allowed.
- Killing bosses/ads from outside of the arena is forbidden.

You can run in multiple categories such as any%, all rememberences/greatrunes/bosses. Any% is just getting the final boss how ever you want.
There are also categories like dlc%, stranded dlc you can find them in the description aswell.
There are more General Rules and lists of banned skips,glichtes, cheeses etc that are linked in the description.

### Intro:

I am bad at Elden Ring.

(insert stupid deaths here)

So naturally I did what any normal person would do, which is doing a hitless run. Surely doing this was a good idea and didn't end in a complete disaster. 
(play epic intro)
### hitless rule thingy part

A hitless run is beating the game without getting hit, that means I can’t lose health or get staggered by anything, I can’t block any incoming attacks or die either, however there are a few exceptions to the rule; Fall damage and environmental damage such as rot damage from the Lake of Rot don’t count as a hit. And to keep things more interesting as well as challenging I can’t quit back to the menu to avoid dealing with enemies or use any unintended glitches or interactions to make things easier for myself.

There are more detailed rules linked in the description but for now let me tell you how I got inspired to go for a no-hit run.

(Try to segway from a chapter to another to maintain a flow instead of jumping from a topic to another)

### Inspiration

The first part of everything is getting the idea. In my case, my biggest source of inspiration was Gino Machino, just watching him hitless the game in so many different ways, like doing it level 1 +0 ng+7 always made think "i wish i am good enough to do a hitless run one day". After wacthing Gino test,route and complete runs on stream and seeing the processes of how you do this runs the desire to do oe aswell got larger, but yet I still didnt do any research on how to do one.
Until one day this video popped up in my youtube recomendations: (insert some upsi from the guide here),wait wrong guide (insert epic recy guide here).

After finding the perfect starting point to get into it surely just followed the guide and got the run without any kind of problems... except that’s not how it went.

(make segway)

### starting doing to do the thing

So after quitting at the start of the guide the first 30 Minutes i finally completed one run through with the guide while making save states for important sections. I did some attempts but never really got past setup and just quit out of frustration and because the dlc was about to drop. So i abandoed it again. 
Until the 15.7 where i randoomly where i said this at 1am (either make a ss of the convo or sum it up idk). But this time it was differnt because i actually stuck to it. Did i really just start a hitless run for a compliment? i guess i did (insert men and compliment meme here)

### talking abt the route and evolution idk

My initial plan for the any% was keeping the iron ball unupgraded for Morgott as he’s one of my favourite fights in the game and I wanted to do something cool in my run, plus fighting him with iron ball was the playstyle I was most comfortable with. 
But wait…doing +0 on Morgott wasn’t enough, I wanted an even bigger challenge, so I decided to buy the Battle Axe at Roundtable Hold to use it for Maliketh as well, another boss that I really love fighting.

#### explaing the final routMy initial plan for the any% was keeping the iron ball unupgraded for Morgott as he’s one of my favourite fights in the game and I wanted to do something cool in my run, plus fighting him with iron ball was the playstyle I was most comfortable with. 
But wait…doing +0 on Morgott wasn’t enough, I wanted an even bigger challenge, so I decided to buy the Battle Axe at Roundtable Hold to use it for Maliketh as well, another boss that I really love fighting.

This idea was great on paper but had one tiny issue, if I can’t upgrade the Iron ball before defeating Morgott, what weapon should I use for the bosses prior? 
to use for margit, godrick and radahn (write names on screen here, instead of naming each one out)
I wanted an option that was fast to grab, strong enough to carry me through the early game and with an enjoyable moveset, the weapon that matched all the criteria ended up being the Lordsworn’s Greatsword as you can get it right after talking to Melina at Gatefront which was suggested by Enfrax (Optional).
And so, I had the plan to fight all bosses before Morgott with the Lordsworn’s Greatsword, I also considered fighting Goldfrey with the unupgraded iron ball as well, but that turned out to be horrible because his area was incredibly laggy so I quickly scrapped that idea.
And because I was upgrading two different weapons; the Lordsworn Greatsword before Morgott and the Iron Ball after, I had to go through the Raya Lucaria Cave to defeat the Crystalian boss there and unlock the Smithing Bell Bearing. I kept overthinking the strategies against the boss. I tried backstabbing him to death. then I tried to get a stance break with Rogier’s Rapier, not knowing that the poise values were nerfed so I ended up panicking and using memory of grace when he didn’t get staggered in two charged attacks. [Crystalian boneout](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkxbub1ayZT22DFeFd0OrjHw9yC9T5V3qRx)

The entirety of the crystal cave fiasco brought many stupid hits with it the dumbest of them being hit by a rune bear under the academy gate, which I didn’t know existed before.
This definitely didn’t become a meme in any way shape or form. (insert a screenshot of the foreshadowing definition) [bear witness](https://clips.twitch.tv/PuzzledArtsyTapir4Head-hkQCleieXHyt0rPH) 
Since I was using Red-Feathered Branchsword, I made [this](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxiUe4_ZtuptiUHa_1Sag3l8Vj40BcxMRn) neat strat to quickly kill the knight in Fort Haight and grab bloody slash so I could drop down to the 20% HP mark faster than using assassin’s gambit. (add explanation to strat)
After a while of using this route, having to upgrade multiple weapons became somewhat tedious, so I fully switched to the Lordsworn’s Greatsword just so I could keep the +0 Morgott kill in the run, I did a lot of testing and practicing, learned new strategies for the bosses and once I was confident with it, I went for a run and the route was much more efficient and at least 15 minutes faster than the previous one.

I didn’t edit much from here on, just grammatical corrections since Idk the strats :ok:

The new and improved strats were the following:
- Firegiant
  - This boss actually broke me.
  - Somehow i am really bad at aiming my weapon to hit his weak spots (make pretty image showing them from all angles)
  - Additionally i struggled with keeing track of where his foot ends up after breaking the ankle.
  - To midigate this there is a strat(idk who made the strat i need figure this out so its accurate or just say strat in general) [thing](https://discord.com/channels/493839512892342292/905828840578895922/1277589392956981369).
  - You buff at this tree to always bait his running slam. 
    - there are 3 options which he can do in this position. (make a clip for each)
    - the options are
      - avalance into running slam (most common)
        - roll avalance and horse in (clip to demonstrate and explain better)
      - avalance into nothing (rare)
        - roll and run back on horse to bait it
      - nothing into running slam (rare)
        - run forward on foot under it
  - after this you want to postion yourself arround here (insert epic image) and cr2 to break his ankle
  - walk to the leg and cr2 twice from behind to hit the weakspot 
  - jump r2 him to stagger him out of the roll that he wil always do.
  - throw 2 sleep pots rebuff fmgs drink your blue flask and position yourself under his hair, aim slightly forward left (insert another epic image) and cr2 twice. 
  - This will bring him to p2 where you rebuff golden vow at the start and then run to this bush (another epic image) and cr2 his hand twice which will stun him. However the fire pillars which he spawns are rng and it can hit you be warry of that (note: test and figoure at a way to make it safer) (insert clip of me dying to it [fg pillars](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxtTQnCmQa5-H-k2Q0lkP2qtnomKjn2otp)) 
  - throw 2 sleep pots at his eye or head it doenst matter and sprint to his left hand to do 3 crs and one r2 to stun him, run to the hand and finish him off with a cr2
- Godskin Dou
  - Since the ls gs doesnt do strike damage like balls, onecyceling them is really easy and and the only thing you need to pay attention for is to hit noble in a way where you dont get the stealth bonus (show img) or do <insert brian strat here>. Addiotnally if you use rtsr it do not level your str to more than 62. Record epic clip of it. [gdou](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx9Su8dPFsaIv8jzEl-uEwKOP-WOI5iB_w?si=e5g7MGQ9zpUv9rw5)
- Gideon
  - Stays the same as with Iron balls just 3 cr2s
- Horrah loux
  - You cant script this boss, but instead you can script a stun at the start of phase 2 so you cana skip that.
  - To do this you need to strafe the first opener and cr2 it, then you only punish with r1s and stay on his right or left side so he doenst do his phase 1.5 transition. 
  - After he stuns you dont riposte and stay infront of him and wait until he starts his phase 1.5 transition and do one cr2 and one r2.
  - At the start of phase 2 imidiatly do a cr2 roll the opener and do another cr2, this stun him and afer riposting you can finish him of during his phase 2.5 tranisition.
  - [clip](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxDVfIZCjPDH2OFkIvacscc6lzUxhhNV5u?si=CtKR04bM7OPHN9UK)
- radabeast
  - You cant fully script radagon with this weapon like you can balls/starfist, so naturally i decided to kill radagon with +0 balls in the run.
  - if you use cragblade, golden vow and flame grant me strength you obliterate radagon with pure damage even on +0 and he only does a few unscripted attacks
  - After killing radagon you have enough time to switch to the ls gs and cast cragblade and flame grant me strengh which is enough to fully script elden beast.

### Intro:

I am bad at Elden Ring.

(insert stupid deaths here)

So naturally I did what any normal person would do, which is doing a hitless run. Surely doing this was a good idea and didn't end in a complete disaster.Â 

(play epic intro)

### hitless rule thingy part

A hitless run is beating the game without getting hit but here are the the rules which you can find on the teamhitless website:

- A hit is defined by a loss of health and/or stagger caused by an enemy.
- Hits from player triggered traps count.
- Environmental damage caused by static features as lava, water, swamp, spikes, campfires do not count as a hit.
- Fall damage does not count as a hit, but a death from falling does.
- Blocking an enemy counts as a hit, but a perfect parry does not.
- Quit-outs are generally not allowed, except when in the main hub or after sitting down at a grace.
- Summon Ashes and NPC summons are allowed. Player summons are not allowed.
- Killing bosses/ads from outside of the arena is forbidden.
[rules](https://www.teamhitless.com/games/fromsoftware-games/elden-ring/)

You can run in multiple categories such as any%, all rememberences/greatrunes/bosses. Any% is just getting the final boss how ever you want.
There are also categories like dlc%, stranded dlc you can find them in the description aswell.
There are more General Rules and lists of banned skips,glichtes, cheeses etc that are linked in the description.

### getting inspired to do the run

The first part of everything is getting the idea. In my case, my biggest source of inspiration was Gino Machino, just watching him hitless the game in so many different ways, like doing it level 1 +0 ng+7 always made think "i wish i am good enough to do a hitless run one day". After wacthing Gino test,route and complete runs on stream and seeing the processes of how you do this runs the desire to do oe aswell got larger, but yet I still didnt do any research on how to do one.
Until one day this video popped up in my youtube recomendations: (insert some upsi from the guide here),wait wrong guide (insert epic recy guide here).

After finding the perfect starting point to get into it surely just followed the guide and got the run without any kind of problems.

### starting doing to do the thing

So after quitting at the start of the guide the first 30 Minutes i finally completed one run through with the guide while making save states for important sections. I did some attempts but never really got past setup and just quit out of frustration and because the dlc was about to drop. So i abandoed it again. 
Until the 15.7 where i randoomly where i said this at 1am (either make a ss of the convo or sum it up idk). But this time it was differnt because i actually stuck to it. Did i really just start a hitless run for a compliment? i guess i did (insert men and compliment meme here)

### talking abt the route and evolution idk

As it stands now the current route is any% but keep the iron balls +0 for morgott. The question now was what weapon to use for margit, godrick and radahn, since i just planed to +0 goldfrey with balls awell, which is a horrible idea because this area is the laggiest thing ever and you get your inputs eaten left and right. Through some asking and testing i figured out how to deal with margit, godrick and Radahn with the Lorsworn Greatsword. 

Doing +0 Morgott wasnt enough so i decided to buy the battle axe at Rounddtable to use it for Maliketh.
Because i do two kills at +0 no aux i decided to get rtsr, for which i made [this](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxiUe4_ZtuptiUHa_1Sag3l8Vj40BcxMRn) neat strat to grab blood slash so setting it up doenst take an eternity.

Now since i had the brilliant idea to upgrade the balls after morgott because i didnt even think of testing the rest of the bosses with the ls gs, so i just grabbed grabbed the smithing bellbearing 1, which ended in a total disaster, where i failed to figure out that i justd need to cr2 twice with balls and crabblade to always break the crystalions stance. I even tried using Rogiers Rapier for a stance break which i tested on a live run and ended in this disaster: [crystalion boneout](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkxbub1ayZT22DFeFd0OrjHw9yC9T5V3qRx)


### more at the end but idk heading herere anyway

Addiction amongst youth and what we can do about it!

Hi everyone!
Today I want to write about addiction amonst young people, to which a statistic As i am young myself, i felt the need to write about this.

First of all lets break down the results: The main results from the bar chart show, that by far marijuana is the most common addiction amonst UK youth which is followed by alcohol and presription drugs. For age 18-26 prescription drugs lead the chart.

Now, you might ask yourself how addictions can affect the lives of young people. Most effects can be categorized into physical and social issues. Physical issues are for example the damage to your liver that is caused by Alcoholconsumption. Arguing with your friends and faminly would be an example for a social issue.

Lets think about what schools can do to prevent this. In my opinion pupils should be educated about the risks of comsuming drugs and if they plan to try them anyways information on how they can do that in a safe and controlled environment should be provided. 

What do you think about that? If you have any more thoughts about it feel free to leave a comment and join the disccusion down below.
